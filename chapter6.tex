\chapter{Monte Carlo and Data}
\label{ch:mc_data}

The search for semi-visible jets via s-channel production presented in the following chapters is performed with 139 \fb of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector during Run 2 (2015 - 2018). The full Run-2 dataset is used for the final interpretation, but Monte Carlo simulations of background processes and the semi-visible jet signal process are used in the development of the analysis strategy, and to set limits on the observed cross-section of the signal model.
