\chapter{Machine Learning Tools}
\label{ch:ml_tools}

This analysis relies on machine learning tools that train over low-level information, namely tracks of the leading two jets.
The subtlety of the shower differences between dark and SM QCD motivates a complex model that can accept high-dimensional low-level inputs to best understand key differences between signal and background correlations.
Events used in the training of ML tools and to which ML-based selections are applied are subject to the analysis level preselection described in Section~\ref{sec:eventsel}.
All models and training code can be found in Gitlab~\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.cern.ch/jgonski/svj-vae/}}.
