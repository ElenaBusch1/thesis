\chapter{The Standard Model}
Four fundamental forces

The Standard Model is a universally accepted framework which explains most of the interactions of fundamental particles. The SM is a renormalizable quantum field theory that obeys the local symmetry $G_{SM}$:
\begin{equation}
	G_{SM} = SU(3)_C \cross SU(2)_L \cross U(1)_Y
\end{equation}

The $SU(3)_C$ symmetry component is the non-Abelian gauge group of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. There are 8 generators for the $SU_C (3)$ group which correspond to $gluons$, massless spin-1 gauge boson which carry the force of the strong interaction. Gluon and quarks, the particles which interact with the strong force, carry a color charge $C$. \par

The $SU(2)_L \cross U(1)_Y$ symmetry group represents the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. There are 4 generators for this group, which correspond to the four massless gauge bosons $W^1$, $W^2$, $W^3$, and B. From these massless gauge bosons are formed the massive mediators of the weak force, the $W^-$, $W^+$ and $Z^0$ bosons, and the massless electromagnetic force carrier, the photon $\gamma$. \par

The interplay between the fermionic and bosonic fields that emerge from the $G_SM$ symmetry can be described through the Lagrangian in equation \ref{eq:SM_lang}

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{kin} + \mathcal{L}_{\psi} + \mathcal{L}_{Yuk} + \mathcal{L}_{\phi}
	\label{eq:SM_lang}
\end{equation}

Each term in this Lagrangian describes a set of specific particle physics interactions. $\mathcal{L}_{kin} $

. with three families of quarks and leptons, and a scalar Higgs doublet. The standard model has 12 gauge bosons: 8 gluons, 3 weak bosons, and the photon. \cite{pdg}
	

	
The physics of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is summarized by the SM Lagrangian:

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{kin} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}
\end{equation}
