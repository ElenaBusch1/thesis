\chapter{The Standard Model}
The Standard model of particle physics (SM) is the most complete and experimentally validated theory of particle physics. The SM provides a framework describining the set of fundanamental particles and the interactions which govern them. It consists of six quarks, six leptons, four force-mediating gauge bosons, and the Higgs boson, as seen in Fig \ref{fig:standard_model}. 

\section{Symmetries and Forces}
The SM is locally gauge-invariant quantum field theory, a formalism that unites the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, special relativity, and classical field theory.
